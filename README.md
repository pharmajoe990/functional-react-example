# Simple TODO UI Application using functional programming techniques

Aims to implement basic functional programming techniques and Typescript libraries. Not purely functional as Web UI applications by nature are pretty side-effecty, and so is the react API. Where possible however use pure functions, composition and referential transparency. Heavily inspired by the following:

* [Learn fp-ts](https://zanza00.gitbook.io/learn-fp-ts/taskeither/taskeither-and-io-ts)
* [taskeither and io.ts CodeSandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/zanza00/learn-fp-ts/tree/master/examples/taskeither/with-io-ts?module=/src/example.ts&file=/src/example.ts)
* [Ryan Lee's blog: Practical Guide to Fp-ts: P1 â€” Pipe and Flow](https://rlee.dev/writing/practical-guide-to-fp-ts-part-1)
* [dev.to: fp-ts, sequenceT, and sweet sweet async typed FP](https://dev.to/gnomff_65/fp-ts-sequencet-and-sweet-sweet-async-typed-fp-5aop)

Makes use of the following libraries:

* [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts)
* [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts/blob/master/index.md)

## TODO

* linting configuration
* tests
